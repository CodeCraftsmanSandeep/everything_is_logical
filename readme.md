# 🚀 DSA & CP Scribblings

Welcome to my repository! This is where I jot down my notes and practice materials for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Competitive Programming (CP)**. Dive in and explore!

> **Note:** This repository is continuously being updated and improved. Stay tuned for new content and enhancements! 🔄

## 📑 Table of Contents

| **Name** | **Quick Notes** |
|:--|:---|
| [📘 algorithms](algorithms/) | Explore cool algorithms with related materials, code, and notes. |
| [🔧 C++](C++) | My personal notes on C++ along with my implementations of the Standard Template Library (STL). |
| [📚 data_structures](data_structures/) | Dive into various data structures, related problems, and my custom implementations. |
| [😎 problems](problems) | A collection of interesting problems. Check out the list of problems in [problems/readme.md](problems/readme.md). |
| [♻️ reuse](reuse) | Frequently reused concepts in problem solving. |

## 📝 Notes

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**:
  - Check out this [GFG article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cyclomatic-complexity/) for a deep dive into understanding cyclomatic complexity.
  
- **Handy Orders for Problem Solving**:
  - `1e9 < 2^(31) - 1 < 1e10`  
    (Where \(2^{31} - 1 = 2.147 \times 1e9\))
  - `1e18 < 2^(63) - 1 < 1e19`  
    (Where \(2^{63} - 1 = 9.22 \times 1e18\))
