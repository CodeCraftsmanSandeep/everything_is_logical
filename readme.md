## 📝 Notes

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**:
  - Check out this [GFG article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cyclomatic-complexity/) for a deep dive into understanding cyclomatic complexity.
  
- **Handy Orders for Problem Solving**:
  - `1e9 < 2^(31) - 1 < 1e10`  
    (Where \(2^{31} - 1 = 2.147 \times 1e9\))
  - `1e18 < 2^(63) - 1 < 1e19`  
    (Where \(2^{63} - 1 = 9.22 \times 1e18\))

- Complexity analysis
  - Amortized analysis:
    - Amortized time complexity is a method for analyzing the average time complexity of a sequence of operations in an algorithm, rather than the worst-case time complexity of a single operation.
    - This approach is particularly useful for algorithms that have expensive operations that happen only rarely, such as:
      - Eg: Dynamic arrays, DSU using path compression. 
      - Amortized time complexity typically refers to analyzing the average time per operation over a sequence of operations, and is not typically used to describe Quick Sort. Instead, it's the average-case complexity that is Θ(n log n) for Quick Sort.
