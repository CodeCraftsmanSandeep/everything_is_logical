# üìö Stack Concepts and Problems

## üìù Key Concepts

- **Computers Evaluate Using Postfix Expressions**:  
  - Computers naturally evaluate expressions in postfix notation.
  - **Stacks** can be effectively used to convert between different expression notations: postfix, infix, and prefix. This is a fundamental application of stacks in computer science.

- Expressions:
   - Infix expressions, Prefix expression (polish notation) and Postfix expression (reverse polish notation)
   - [Infix to Postfix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/infix-to-postfix-1587115620/1)
      - [infix_to_postfix.cpp](infix_to_postfix.cpp)
