# üìö Stack Concepts and Problems

Welcome to the Stack repository! This repository contains a collection of notes and practice problems centered around the stack data structure, its applications, and related algorithms.

## üìù Key Concepts

- **Computers Evaluate Using Postfix Expressions**:  
  - Computers naturally evaluate expressions in postfix notation.
  - **Stacks** can be effectively used to convert between different expression notations: postfix, infix, and prefix. This is a fundamental application of stacks in computer science.

## üß© Practice Problems
