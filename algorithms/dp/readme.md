## Subarrays, Subsequences, Substrings problems:
- Number of times string s2 appears as sub-seqeunce in string s1
  - [question](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-number-of-times-a-string-occurs-as-a-subsequence3020/1?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article&itm_campaign=practice_card)
- Number of times string 2 apperas as sub-string in string s1
  - [article](https://www.sanfoundry.com/c-program-count-occurrence-substring/)
  - not sure whether this is the optimized
- Find the Longest Increasing Subseqeunce
  - [article](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/solutions/1326308/c-python-dp-binary-search-bit-segment-tree-solutions-picture-explain-o-nlogn/)
  - cool approaches:
    - [LIS_dp.cpp](LIS_dp.cpp)
    - [LIS_binary_search.cpp](LIS_binary_search.cpp)
    - [LIS_segment_tree.cpp](LIS_segment_tree.cpp)
    - LIS_BIT.cpp yet to come!!
- Longest consecutive sub-sequence
  - see blind 75 solutions for solution
- [Maximum product subarray](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-product-subarray3604/1)
  - O(n) time, O(1) solution: [maximumProductSubarray.cpp](maximumProductSubarray.cpp)
