# Introudction
- C is a procedural language.
- C++ is primarily an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, but it also supports procedural programming. This means that C++ is a multi-paradigm language, combining both procedural and object-oriented features, along with other paradigms like generic and functional programming.
- Main differences in C and C++
    - C++ supports OOPs paradigm while C only has the procedural concept of programming.
    - C++ has exception handling capabilities. In C, we have to resolve exceptions manually.
    - There are no references in C.
- C/C++ are **statically typed languages**.
    - This means that the data type of each variable is known at compile time. You must declare the type of every variable (e.g., int, float, char) before you use it, and the type cannot change at runtime.
- In contrast, dynamically typed languages determine the data types of variables at runtime, and variables can change their type during execution (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- C and C++ are fast because statically typed languages are faster than dynamically typed languages.
- C/C++ are general purpose languages.
    - SQL, HTML, Verilog are not general purpose programming languages.
- Mid, Low, High level languages
    - High level languages
        - Python, Java
    - Mid level languages
        - C, C++
    - Low level languages
        - Assembly languages
        - Machine code
- auto keyword is present in C but is redundant. 
    - auto in C and C++ are completely different.

3) [static variables in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-variables-in-c/)
    - static variables are initialized with zero, if not explicitly initialized.
    - static variables and global variables are stored in data segment.

6) Conversions
    - string to integer
        - atoi and strtol, strtoll: [atoi_strtol.c](atoi_strtol.c)
        - strtol is safer to use.
    - integer to string conversion
        - can be done by using sprintf.
7) printf 
    - [printf.c](printf.c)

8) sprintf
    - [sprintf.c](sprintf.c)
    - sprintf stand for string print.
9) scanf
    - scanf stands for scan fromatted string.
